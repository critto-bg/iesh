ie_shell.py - Simple shell for Infinity Engine-based game files
===============================================================


Installation:
-------------
None at present, just untar it somewhere

Configuration:
--------------

Edit ie_shell.py:

game_dir 
    - directory where the game you are interested in is installed

chitin_file
dialog_file 
    - names of RESREF and STRREF index files, located in game_dir.
      Edit the names if the case does not match


Running:
--------
Just type ./ie_shell.py or python ./ie_shell.py and you should see 
dots marking progress as the program loads CHITIN.KEY and DIALOG.TLK.

!!! This might take *extremely* long time on a slow computer and
a significant portion of memory. If it's too slow or too big, then
this proggie just is not for you :( !!! 

Once the files are loaded, you get Cmd: prompt, where you can type
python statements (only those fitting on one line atm).

Now you can load files, inspect their contents, search them and export
objects out of them.

The following resource formats are recognized in this version:
  KEY
  TLK
  BIFF (only file records)
  WMAP
  CHUI

Type `?' or `help' to get some online help and `q', `quit' or ^D
to exit the program.
