ie_shell - Simple Python shell for exploring Infinity Engine-based game files
==============================================================================


Installation:
-------------
None at present, just untar the tarball somewhere convenient.

Package contents:
  ./ie_shell.py
  ./data/ - directory for storing exported data, provided for convenience

  ./formats/format.py
  ./formats/stream.py
  ./formats/bam.py
  ...
  ./formats/wmap.py

  ./plugins/core.py
  ./plugins/builtins.py
  ./plugins/...


Configuration:
--------------

Edit ie_shell.py:

game_dir 
    - directory where the game you are interested in is installed

chitin_file
dialog_file 
    - names of RESREF and STRREF index files, located in game_dir.
      Edit the names if the case does not match

Other files:
  $HOME/.iesh_profile
  $HOME/.iesh_history


Running:
--------
Just type ./ie_shell.py or python ./ie_shell.py and you should see 
dots marking progress as the program loads CHITIN.KEY and DIALOG.TLK.

!!! This might take *extremely* long time on a slow computer and
a significant portion of memory. If it's too slow or too big, then
this proggie just is not for you :( !!! 

Once the files are loaded, you get Cmd: prompt, where you can type
python statements.

Now you can load files, inspect their contents, search them and export
objects out of them.

The following resource formats are recognized in this version:
  BAM
  BIFF  (only file records)
  CHUI
  CRE   (only partial)
  IDS
  ITM
  KEY
  TLK
  WMAP

Type `?' or `help' to get some online help and `q', `quit' or ^D
to exit the program.
